## Hi there 👋 I'm John

I'm a full-stack developer at Kroger, building with TypeScript and React at work and microcontrollers at home. I bring a hardware hacker's pragmatism to software. I solve problems and never write the same code twice if I can avoid it.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a strategy survival game (private repo)
